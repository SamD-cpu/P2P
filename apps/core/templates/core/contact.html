<h2>About credit card</h2><p>It is safe to use your credit card. Because our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
    software is the industry standard, it is the best software for e-commerce transactions. It will encrypt
     your credit card number and details.</p><h2>What did my credit card be rejected?</h2><p>There are many 
         reasons for credit card transactions being rejected.The most common reason is that the address you 
         entered does not match your billing address.If this happens, please try again with the correct billing address.</p>
         <p>Simple input errors can also result in transactions being rejected, including finding the wrong credit card number, 
             expiration date, or incorrect CVN code (the security number on the back of the card).</p>
             <h2>If your credit is not passed, I have some suggestions:</h2>
             <ul><li>- Wait a day and try again</li>
                <li>- Make sure your card has not exceeded its limit</li>
                <li>- Make sure your credit card has not expired</li>
                <li>- Make sure to enter the correct name on the front of the card</li>
                <li>- Try another credit card</li></ul>
